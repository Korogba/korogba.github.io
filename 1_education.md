                    <p align="justify"> My work as a post-graduate student was focused mainly in the field of Artificial Intelligence
                    and multi-objective optimization. Major achievements include presentation of the paper titled: Many 
                    Objective Swarm Optimization using Controlling Area of Dominance and Shift-Based Density Estimator at
                    the 4th annual international conference and workshop on Mathematical analysis and optimization, 2017.
                    As a member of the Mathematical Analysis and Optimization Research Group MANORG, my research focuses on 
                    the emulation of natural processes such as the crowd intelligence displayed by a flock of birds, 
                    natural selection in evolution and deep learning in the neurons of the human brain to 
                    build algorithms that can be trained to think and make intelligent inferences.

                    was a web-based assessment portal that extends the domain of the classroom to the web. It facilitates
                    interaction between tutors and students by allowing tutors upload classworks, solutions and results while
                    students can register for courses, get notifications for those courses and have access to materials for 
                    registered courses.
