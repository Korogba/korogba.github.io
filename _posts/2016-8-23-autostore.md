Auto-Store is an online database of auto-mechanic stores along with details such as auto parts, prices and locations of those stores. 
It also allows searching for specific items in the database with various filters such as location, auto parts etc. 
The application is hosted using a cloud service called Heroku that has support for composer, git, laravel and easy database 
integration. While this service is paid, they do have a free plan that hosts the app for free for up to 18 hours in 
any 24-hour period. This means a visit to the link might display a page not found error hosted if it is in the inactive 
period of the 24 hours.
 
The web application was built using Laravel framework with a MySQL database for persistence. Bootstrap was used to built the user
interface.<br/>
