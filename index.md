In the [tweets](https://twitter.com/tejucole/status/356248048604684288) 
of Teju Cole, “The basic question which no public event alters: 
how can I, myself, in my limited sphere of influence, 
be more just?” I will extend that to include not just 
being just but doing the best you can within your level 
of skill and expertise to make a positive impression in
whatever environment or situation you find yourself.
We will not all change the world. But we can all make 
differences however small or remote in the little 
spheres of influences we command. This is one of my 
guiding principles. That with the skills I have 
acquired and with the vast inter-connectivity 
afforded by latest trends in information technology, 
I will ensure that while nurturing lofty dreams of 
changing the world I make a positive impact on my 
immediate environment. With every little step, 
every job properly executed, every person positively 
influenced, we are not only rewarded personally and 
financially, we are well on way to changing the world 
we live in for better. <br><br> Are you not inspired? :) Now click the link below
